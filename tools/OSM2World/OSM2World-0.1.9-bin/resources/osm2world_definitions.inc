/*
 * This is an example for a POVRay include file that can be used to configure the rendering
 * of .pov files generated with OSM2World (http://osm2world.org/).
 *
 * You can leave out any definition from this file, the rendering will then fall back
 * to (mostly very basic) default materials and shapes.
 * Please be aware that many possible definitions are not listed in this example file.
 * Examine the "material and object definitions" section of a .pov file generated
 * by OSM2World to see what definitions are used by that particular scene.
